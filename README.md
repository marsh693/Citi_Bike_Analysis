# Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of this module was to use Tableau to create a solid business proposal to convince investors that a bikesharing program would be a good idea in Des Moines. We were tasked to create mulitple visualizations to help answer additional questions that support the claim of a bikesharing program being started in Des Moines.

- This images shows the Checkout times for the users by gender. As you can see there are three different lines, one for male users, one for female users    and one for users who wished to not disclose their gender. The gray line represents the male users. The blue line the female users, and the red line        represents those users who did not disclose their gender.

- This is a heatmap constructed to show the most popular starting times during the week. As you can see the most popular times to start are in the        evening, where as the least popular start times are in the middle of the night.

- The heatmap above shows the same start times but now broken down by gender. Both male and female users seem to show similar patterns relating to their start time. As you can see the male users have darker portions on their map compared to the female and unknown users. This heatmap relates to the second visualization created, as in that graph the majority of users were male users shown by the gray line.

- This heatmap shows the number of trips by user types, then broken down by gender. Just like the previous heatmap created and the second visualization you can see that more users tend to be male. You can also see that subscribers of the bikesharing program will participate more than those who are not subscribing.

# Summary
Based on the results, we can conclude that a bikesharing program is a good idea for the city of Des Moines. During the week the bikes are heavily utilized during the early evening hours. Though the majority of the users were those who subscribe to the bikesharing program, some who are not subscribers still utilize the program and may even decide to subscribe in the future.
  
  1) A visualization showing the start and stop coordinates (using longitude and latitude), may be beneficial to further see which locations the bikesharing program is more popular in.
  
  2) Collecting data on weather patterns and visualizing those patterns with start times would be beneficial to futher understand how weather patterns play in to those who participate in the bikesharing program.
